            <h2> Alma 34 : 9 </h2>
            <p>9. For it is expedient that an aatonement should be made; for according to the great bplan of the Eternal
                God there must be
                an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are
                cfallen and are
                lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made</p>

            <h2> Ether 12 : 33 - 34 </h2>
            <p>33 And again, I remember that thou hast said that thou hast aloved the world, even unto the laying down
                of thy life for
                the world, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for the children of men.
                <br>
                34. And now I know that this alove which thou hast had for the children of men is charity; wherefore,
                except men shall
                have charity they cannot inherit that place which thou hast prepared in the mansions of thy Father.
